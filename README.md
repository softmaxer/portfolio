# Personal Portfolio

This is the source code of my personal website that I'm building in NextJS and tailwind

## Motivation

I initially wanted to code this blog / personal website in HTMX with templating with Go. However, I decided to learn a "real" frontend framework, so I chose NextJS as I recently got introduced to it at work because of Vercel.
